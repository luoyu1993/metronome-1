Simple metronome
================
Use it here: [annoying.site](http://annoying.site)

What?
=====
It's a metronome.

Why?
====
One day I was looking for a metronome and the first page of search
results was full of really bad ones, so I decided to make this simple app.

So what?
========
This repository is not an example of how to make metronomes right,
do not rely on it in any case, the code is bad,
the author is incompetent, I just wanted a metronome. 

If you have a feature request, or you want to submit a bug,
you're welcome, I will take a look, someday.
